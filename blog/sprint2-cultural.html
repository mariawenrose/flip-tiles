            Culture has and always will be a big part of my identity.
          </h2>
          <p>It's a massive influence in the way in which I behave and orient myself.</p>
          <p>At the forefront, my mum is Chinese and my Dad is a Kiwi. Having a fruit salad of a background has been pretty conflicting at times - I will admit.</p>
          <p>Differences around showing/sharing emotions and thoughts, dress sense and a general attitude around what is classed as "spicy" are all part of the mixture.</p>
          <p>_______</p>
          <p>
            As a precursor, the internet to me is a scary place, not because of who might read what I'm saying now, but because of who might see it in the future. So if this is all somewhat telling 
            but also very monotonously vague too, I apologise. But also, thank you for your patience :)
