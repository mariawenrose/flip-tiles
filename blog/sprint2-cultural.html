            <p>My long term goal/career pathway is to wake up everyday and feel excited or passionate about the job I am going to. Whether it's web or design, I just want to be in a role that allows me build things and be around other people who have similar values.</p>

            <p>The Human Skills I would like to develop are quieting the monkey mind and cultivating assertiveness and the confidence to speak from a place of truth without fear. I find it difficult to ask others for help.</p>

            <p>My strengths would be the ability to have a calm exterior and self reflection. A limitation would be too much self reflection and internal dialogue. Not communicating how I really feel about things. I am also very stubborn and will tend to disconnect from "the real world" to my own mental and physical detriment if I am focused on something.</p>

          <div class="card-body">
            <p>I will manage myself within the programme by setting goals, doing the things I say I am going to do and holding myself accoutable for those tasks. Communicating when I am stuck or need help. Taking regular breaks in order to maintain a healthy physical and mental balance throughout the duration of my course. </p>

            <p>If I need help, first I will make an attempt to solve the problem and understand what isn't working. If I feel I have tried first, then I will ask for help. I will do so within a time period where the person does not feel I am intruding into their "outside of EDA time"</p>

            <p>My hope/expectation would to be treated respectfully and not patronized. To recieve help and explanation if I do not understand something. To encourage me to seek solutions myself and prompt me in the right direction if need be. For me to feel that I am able to communicate and be heard. </p>
