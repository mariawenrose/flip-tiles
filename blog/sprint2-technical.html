            here the div is positioning itself 50% from the top of the container, and the blue block is pushing it down by an extra 10%

      <h4>Absolute Positioning</h4>
      <p>
        • It pretty much ignores everything else that is happening on the page and puts itself where you tell it to go. e.g top, left<br>
        <br>
        • The example above shows the div positioning itself 0% from the top of the container, and 5% from the left <br>
        <br>
        • An element with this type of positioning is not affected by the positioning of other elements and it doesn't affect other elements.<br>
        <br>
        • Because of it's permanent nature, it can limit the flexibility of your site because the div will always remain 10% from the top and 30% from the left of the container.<br>
        <br>
        <b>NOTE:</b> The parent is called "container" and has a position of RELATIVE, if it was static or did not exist the absolute div would position itself differently.

      <h4>Relative Positioning</h4>
      <p>
        • Places itself relative to it's parent element, it's gonna move around a lot more so that it stays with it's mum or dad.<br>
        <br>
        • It's pretty similar to absoulte but it's not. Confusing huh, but when screens get responsive it's nowhere near as much as a headache as absolute.<br>
        <br>
        • The example above shows the div postition 50% from where it would normally be and 50% from the left. The blue block at the top is causing it push down even more by an additional 10%
