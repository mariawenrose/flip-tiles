<body>
  <div class="container">
    <div class="section">
      <div class="absolute">
        <p class="absolute-text">
          <span><b>.absolute-div {</b><br></span>
          position: absolute;<br>
          top: 0%;<br>
          left: 25%;<br>
          <br>
          I have been placed specifically here 0% from the top of the container (which is my parent)
          and 25% from the left. I am removed from the normal flow of the document. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Because of this, I can be placed infront of, or behind other elements such as divs without affecting 
          their placement within the container.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="relative">
        <p class="relative-text">
          <span><b>.relative-div {</b><br></span>
          position: relative;<br>
          top: 50%;<br>
          left: 50%;<br>
          <br>
            I have been told to move away from my original position <span class="blue-text">(the blue div)</span> inside the document. 
          <br>
          <br>
          I am positioned offset 50% from the top, and 50% to the left of my parent (the container). 
        </p>
      </div>
      <!-- README: Not all elements (divs) on screen reflect their real css properties. The placement and written values given on screen were used to visually demonstrate how positioning (fixed, absolute, relative) work within an html document: README -->
      <div class="relative-original-position">
        <div class="relative-original-position-text">
          <h3>.original-relative-div {</h3>
          <p>
            I am the original position of the relative div before I was given "position: relative;"
            <br>
            <br>
            This is where I would sit inside my parent container (in the normal flow of the document).
            <br>
            <br>
            If the above div was not positioned absolute I would be sitting pushed beneath the <span class="pink-text">pink line.</span>
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="fixed">
        <p class="fixed-text">
          <span><b>.fixed-div {</b><br></span>
          position: fixed;<br>
          top: 20%;<br>
          right: 5%;<br>
          <br>
          this lil div will always chill here, stuck to this position on screen because it is fixed 20% from the top and 5% from the right of the screen.
          <br>
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="container-width-key">
      <div><h4><-----------------------</h4></div>
      <h4>container = purple dashed square</h4>
      <div><h4>-----------------------></h4></div>
