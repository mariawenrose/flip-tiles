        <h3>What Is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
        <p>Emotional Intelligence is the skill in which human beings are able to percieve and recognise emotions in themselves and in others.</p>
        <p>A strong focus is given to the ability to regulate ones own emotions and an awareness of where they stem from.</p>
        <p>Emphasis is given to observing, empathising and acknowledging the emotions of those around us. </p>

        <h3>How is it Different to IQ?</h3>
        <p>EQ is centered on abilities such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Identifying emotions</li>
          <li>Evaluating how others feel</li>
          <li>Controlling one's own emotions</li>
          <li>Perceiving how others feel</li>
          <li>Using emotions to facilitate social communication</li>
          <li>Relating to others</li>
        </ul>
        <p>IQ represents abilities such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Visual and spatial processing</li>
          <li>Knowledge of the world</li>
          <li>Fluid reasoning</li>

        <h3>Why is it Important?</h3>
        <p>Emotional intelligence is important because emotions are energy in motion. When we are able to recognise and acknowledge the feelings occuring inside of us
          and the root cause of them, it allows us to control the way in which we orient our behaviour, whether it's soley toward ourselves our toward others.
        </p>
        <p>
          By recognising that by honouring our emotions, we can then choose how to interpret and then what to do with them.
        </p>
        <p>This allows us to create more meaningful relationships with both ourselves and those around us.</p>
