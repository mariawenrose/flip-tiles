      <h2 class="task-heading">An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</h2>
      <p>
        Imagine we are building a house, its generally good practice to use a blueprint. This allows us to imagine the layout of the house before we build - how it's going too look once it's finished:
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML is similar to laying down concrete, we pour cement into the area in which we have already marked out. We need make sure we have a stable foundation for the house to sit on.
        Then we begin building walls, leaving space for plumbing and the electricity further down the track. Once we're satisfied the house is stable and the roof is on - that there are no bedrooms missing, we then begin to furnish and decorate using CSS.
      </p>
      <p>
        CSS is when we begin painting the house, choosing the tiles for the bathroom. Whether or not we want marble countertops in the kitchen. We generally go for consistent style of decor - but there's also nothing stopping you from putting a shag carpet in the garage if it will delight any visitors. 
      </p>
      <p>
        JavaScript is where we start connecting all the wiring, gas and water supplies. Making sure the taps have running water and that the light switches work when they're turned on.

      <h2 class="task-heading">Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life</h2>
      <p>
        Loops and Control flow are comparable to cooking a set meal. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The general flow is to eat the appetizer, the main and then dessert. When we cook a lasagna, we first preheat the oven on before placing the raw ingredients inside to bake. We cannot cook the lasagna if the oven hasn't been turned on beforehand. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Our eating routine is generally a loop, one that starts with breakfast, lunch and dinner. Sometimes we skip breakfast, and if we have already eaten lunch that day then our next meal is dinner. 
      </p>

      <h2 class="task-heading">Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it</h2>
      <p>
        The Document Object Model is the thing that allows us to interact with the interweb. We view the document through a window. What we are seeing is a collection of different text documents that contain instructions. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Those individual documents contain the instructions for how the page will look and behave.
      </p>

    <div class="text-div">
      <h2 class="task-heading">Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</h2>
      <p>
        Both are considered objects, however accessing their contents differs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine we are in a library looking at a single bookshelf. We could order the information using two different index's. One being numerical the other string (text/letters)
      </p>
      <p>
        We ask the librarian "Where might I look to find information about the moon and it's cycles?"
      </p>
      <p>
        If we were to usan Array her reply would be: "Top shelf, inside book number four - contains information about the moon cycle"
      </p>
      <p>
        If we were to use an Oject her reply would be: "Have a browse of the shelves, there is a book titled "Moon Cycle".
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="text-div">
      <h2 class="task-heading">Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h2>
      <p>
        Functions are used withing JavaScript as building blocks to execute/instruct code to perform certain tasks. An example might be a function that multiplies numbers together. E.g 2+2
